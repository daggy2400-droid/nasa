FORCE DEPLOYMENT - Transaction Pooler Fix
==========================================

Issue: Render still using old direct connection (db.pkdmonstyusgkjaqzm.supabase.co)
Expected: Should use Transaction Pooler (aws-1-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543)

Error in logs:
java.net.UnknownHostException: db.pkdmonstyusgkjaqzm.supabase.co

This means Render deployment didn't pick up the new configuration.
Forcing new deployment with timestamp to ensure changes are applied.
